# Blue Screen

This is a simple exercise where we use color thresholds to implement a blue screen.

## Installation

First, create the conda environment and activate it:


```
conda create -n blue-screen python=3.6
source activate blue-screen
```

Then, install the extra packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
